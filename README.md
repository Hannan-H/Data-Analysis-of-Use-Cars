# Used-Cars
It is crucial for both buyers and sellers to analyze the prices and characteristics of used cars so both parties can make informed decisions. In this project I analyze what determines the prices for used cars with Python. Specifically I use NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning. Then I create eye-catching diagrams and charts using Seaborn.


I first begin my cleaning the data from the usedcars.csv file since there are missing values for there are data values with a "?" that must be corrected.
I convert the "?" into  NaN "Not a Number"
In this project I clean and analyze data for used cars using Python Pandas.

After the data was cleaned I used Excel's VLOOKUP to analyze the data and look for specific items.


## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis was downloaded from [IBM SkillBuild](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Data%20files/auto.csv).
